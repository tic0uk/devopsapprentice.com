description: I'm now on my 18th day of learning Python.
---
<a href="/learning-to-code-in-python-day1/">In my last post</a>, I wrote about how I've begun to learn Python using a Udemy course called 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021 by Dr Angela Yu. I've just finished day 18, and it feels like a good time to give a progress update.

As I'm not currently working, I've been able to put a lot of time into studying at the moment. I treat most days as a workday by trying to start at 9 am and finish by 5.30 pm, which I've found helps me keep up a good routine. As well as coding every day, I've begun training for my <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/" target="_blank">AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification</a> which I hope to take in the next few weeks. I'm fitting in the study for this one around any spare time I've got when I'm not learning Python, but learning to code is the bigger priority for me at the moment.

By the end of the first week of coding (which was the end of my first month of full-time study), I made the decision that I was going to stop looking for a job and just focus on study for 6 months. I've worked full-time since leaving university, and having the time to focus on study and my personal projects has  been really good for me. I've achieved a lot within the first month, and I could see that a further 5 months would mean I could learn a lot of the DevOps tools such as Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins, and Kubernetes as well as getting Python under my belt.

Of course, fate had other plans and that very same evening I had a phone call about a potential job opportunity. After talking things through with the team, it was really clear that the job was something quite special. As well as giving me a job that uses my Application Engineer skill set, it also has tons of potential for growth and is with a company that shares my values. There's even the chance I'll be coding the odd bug fix once I'm settled in which would be a real bonus if that comes to something. After a round of interviews, I was offered the position of Senior Solutions Engineer and happily accepted. I'll start there in 6 weeks, which still gives me lots of time to focus on study, so is a great result there too. With 6 weeks to go, I want to make the most of the time I've got and plan to continue to code as much as possible until I start the new job.

In the meantime, the Python course has gone really well and I've been learning things that I didn't think were possible in such a short amount of time. I'm currently at the point where I can write code without the videos, and I'm getting through the lessons daily as planned. The first 7 days went really well. I learnt how to put together a variety of loops, functions, and basic coding principals. Each day gave at least one small task/project and I was surprised how much I was expected to put together the code myself. It was great for my confidence as each time I was successful, it made me feel like I was understanding the material.

Quite early on, I decided to create a GitHub repository where I began to store the code that I've been writing and mostly consists of the daily projects/tasks. If you're interested in seeing what I've been coding, you can find that over <a href="https://github.com/tic0uk/python-100daysofcode" target="_blank">in my GitHub.</a>

Initially, I worked out of the web browser environment at <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank">repl.it</a>. I found this website easy to use, and it got my straight into coding which was a big plus point for me. On the 6th day, I was introduced to a website called <a href="https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Alone&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Falone.json" target="_blank">Reeborg's World</a> as part of the daily lesson. The site has a small robot that you can move around a map and complete tasks by writing Python. By the end of day 6, I'd written a program by myself that made the little robot automatically navigate a maze until it found the exit. There's no way that I could have done this before I started!

The feeling of winning didn't last long! What probably wasn't clear to me from the outset was just how many hours every day was going to take. Each day consists of a set of videos that are usually around 7 to 15 minutes long and so each day shows as generally being around 1 hour to 1.5 hours long. All quite reasonable but there are a lot of points in the day where you're asked to pause and then complete the task given. In the early days, I whizzed through the tasks and it barely added an hour to the time I spent per day, however, on later lessons things began to get tough!

I worked at least 8 hours per day on course days 7 through 11, and one of the days hit the 12 hours mark before I was finished. Most of my time was spent trying to implement a lot of new concepts, and I just needed the time to work through what I'd learnt, read up more on concepts and eventually put together a solution. Not being one to give up, I would plug away for an hour, take a 10-minute break, and then get back on it until I finished which seemed to be a good way of breaking things up.

Looking back at the code I wrote, and now that I've got more experience, I could probably redo them in less than an hour (with much better code) which is a positive sign. Having said that, I managed to come up with a solution that worked every time. It didn't always match Angela's version but I'm proud that I didn't skip ahead and look at the solution until I'd finished.

After day 11, I began to feel like I was 'getting it' again and things became more enjoyable again. The last few days I've been learning object-oriented programming which is a completely new subject but I seem to be picking it up, and my code is beginning to use multiple files, so this is also moving in the right direction. I haven't had to spend as long on a problem since, although it's still taking around 5 hours a day including lunch so I'm really glad that I've got the time to focus on this full-time and make the most of the course.

One last thing is I've now moved onto using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" target="_blank">PyCharm</a> instead of repl.it, and it really is fantastic. I already knew that I wouldn't be using repl.it after the first two weeks, but I was surprised how much it felt like a milestone to graduate to using PyCharm. Already it feels much better using a professional IDE for coding and it has begun to open up many more doors. You could easily write a book on PyCharm as it has so many features and already I can see that it's going to be a big help. I'm glad this is going to be my new home for the remainder of the course.

Thanks for reading,<br>
