Since a very young age, I've loved computers and technology. Windows hadn't been released when I used my first computer, and so I learnt to do everything in the command prompt of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS" target="_blank">MS-DOS.</a>

My father taught me how to use MS-DOS and how to navigate the command line on his work PC that he had at home. He began by introducing me to some games he'd installed. As everything was done on the command line, even loading up a game would involve typing out several commands. It was a great way to learn my way around a computer, and I took to it quickly. My parents saw how much it was becoming a passion of mine, and bought me a computer of my own. I'm very grateful for their support in getting me started.    

It was common that I needed to spend time debugging and fixing issues just to get things working. Looking back, I enjoyed this part just as much as playing games. I became interested in hardware and my parents bought me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster" target="_blank">Creative Soundblaster</a> sound card. This fuelled my passion in computer music and unexpectedly introduced me to the world of IRQ conflicts and the config.sys file, introducing me to OS set up and configuration.

I played a lot of adventure games, which meant both puzzle-solving and a lot of repetitive typing. Early types of games expected you to write the exact sentence and would complain if you made any typos. My spelling and typing skills began to soar from this and I was touch typing by the time I was 7. Graphics and sound began to get better, and computers were evolving quickly. I loved games like the original Prince of Persia and the Sierra On-Line games from the 80s.

I dabbled in some coding using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC" target="_blank">BASIC</a> and would try writing out the odd snippets of code that I'd find in the backs of magazines or books, but at the time I didn't find it that interesting. Once I remember spending days hand-typing out pages and pages of some code I'd found into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sord_M5" target="_blank">Sord M5 computer</a>. There wasn't an explanation of what the code would do. After I finished writing out the code, it drew a picture of Saturn's rings and nothing more. Feeling uninspired, I can't remember trying to code again until after I was an adult.

Looking back, I was a sysadmin at heart. A good weekend to me was spent re-formatting the computer and then setting up the OS and configuring it to run perfectly. Fixing computer issues was very rewarding and most gave immediate feedback. I often could narrow down the problem (even if I didn't understand it fully) and I could delve into finding a way to fix it.
