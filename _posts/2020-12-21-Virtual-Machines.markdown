The first step to getting to learn Linux is to get a copy installed. I was
hesitant at first as I'd always used Windows, and didn't want to uninstall
my main copy in case I didn't get on with Linux. I also was very aware of the wide
variety of 'flavours' of Linux which meant I could find myself wanting to change
versions at the drop of a hat.

If you're on Windows, the two I'd recommend for getting started are 'hyper-v'
or Virtualbox. To the beginner, I'd recommend going with Virtualbox to get
your first introduction to creating

At some point when you are studying Linux, you'll make the wise decision to
stop installing and testing things on your primary Operating System.
