When you're first starting out, a homelab doesn't have to be an expensive rig that takes up lots of space. I'm currently using a single machine for all of my homelab projects and activities.

I'm a firm believer that virtualisation solves the issue of needing numerous machines. In addition, I'd make the argument that more and more production environments move into the cloud, getting experience in running virtual machines and understanding their strengths and limitations is a good skill to pick up. Modern computers will happily run at least one virtual machine at a time, and if you're sensible with resourcing then usually they can run a great deal more than that.

I've experimented with more machines, different hardware, but in reality the set up that I have does everything I need at the moment. If I need another computer in my network, I can simply spin up a new VM, attach it to the virtual network that I've set up and I'm good to go. If I make a mistake on a VM, it's no issue to simply remove the machine. I can use snapshots before any risky moves and restoration to a working known state takes minutes.

My main PC currently has the following specification;

I stopped using Windows as my main OS on both my work and home machine and began to live out of Linux. I still dual boot a copy of Windows at home as I still use it for gaming and photo editingwhen I need to be sure a document will come out as planned), it's mostly gathering dust at the moment.
