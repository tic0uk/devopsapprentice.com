After 6 years of working with Linux, progress had became much slower than I wanted and I felt like I'd hit a roadblock. I gave it some thought, and recognised it was the same feeling that I've experienced with learning to play music.

Take methods of practice;

* Pick a song and play that same song repeatedly for 1 hour each day for a month.
* On day 1 practice two songs for half hour each. On day 2, study some theory and play scales for half hour each. Take the weekend off and if you feel like playing then do whatever you want with no restrictions.

With the first option, you'd expect that you'd become an expert at that song due to the repitition, but actually it's the opposite. Not only will you lose interest in the long run (which impacts all sorts of things), but you only will ever be able to play that one song. With the second option, it may sound like you're spreading yourself thin, but what happens is interesting as 

If you spend a month practising one song over and over, then at the end of the that month, you'll be better at playing that song. your progress will be significantly worse than if you'd split your time . If you instead spread your time out so  

When you first begin anything, if you work at it, it's often quick to learn new things. At first, it can be  overwhelming how much there is to learn, but with some slow and steady progress, you learn to do more and more things. With all of the things that you learn, you have lots of mini victories and you gain confidence. Over the course of a year or two, if you look back, you'll hopefully recognise that you've stacked up a fair chunk of knowledge. If it's going very well, it's quite possible that you begin to feel like you could be a master given a few more years of the same progress. What usually happens though is progress slows down and tangible victories are less frequent.

When I first started with Linux, I didn't know what flavour of Linux to install so I had to spent time researching that. Once I'd decided on the version of Linux, I then had to decide whether to dual boot with Windows, use virtualisation or make it my main OS. All of those choices needed some research before I could make a decision. After deciding on virtualisation, I then had to decide on the virtualisation software I would use and work out how to use that. Next I had to decide what specifications to give the VM such as how much disk space, RAM, CPUs to assign etc. You get the idea.

There's a lot of things  need to research and learn, and it all takes time. All of the above took time, but there were real results at the end. Not only did I get my copy of Linux installed, but it was set up exactly how I wanted.


The first few times you played with Linux it might have taken you anywhere from a couple of hours to a couple of months to get your perfect set up.

 your first server and get it serving a generic home page using guides on the web. Setting yourself the task to install a web server on a version of Linux   give an example, back in the day when I first set up a copy of Apache running on Linux on a local machine, it took ages to get things up and running. run everything as root can easily it might have taken you time to get Linux set up, more time to research the decide to go with Apache over say Nginx,

 Prior to that it may have taken you two days to get a copy of Linux installed in a VM. On future occasions it takes you a fraction of the time.   You'll spend two days working on a problem that takes 15 seconds to fix once you know the answer.  

 progress slows down and it's quite easy to find that you know a lot of areas but don't have the technical depth, or contrary you'll have completed a deep-dive into specific areas and won't have the variety. The only way to combat this is to

To give an example, to apply to become a sysadmin I had to complete a technical test and a techinical Q&A. In preparation, I spent around a week running through lots of different things. I set up a local server from scratch, practised adding and removing block storage, installed and configured Apache, PHP and a database, and a wide variety of tasks that I hoped might be called upon for a technical test for a syadmin supporting infrastructure for web applications. Without giving any spoilers in case they still use the test, I solved the test quickly and with no fuss whatsoever. I'm quite sure that if I hadn't have ran through the practice I did, then I wouldn't have passed.
