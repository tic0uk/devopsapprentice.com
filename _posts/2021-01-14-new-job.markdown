description: I'm now on my 7th day of learning Python.

After a long talk the other day with my wife, I made the decision that I was going to stop looking for a job and focus on study for 6 months. It was incredibly liberating to think that I could have the time to commit to this for 6 months with no other commitments.;

Of course the way things go, that same evening, I received a very interesting call about a potential job coming up that sounds like it was written for me. It's sounds within my skill set, has tons of potential for growth and is with a company that shares my values. I'm genuinely excited by the sound of the job so I'm preparing for a round of interviews there.

If that doesn't work out, then my fallback plan will be to commit to studying for 6 months, and so it's a win-win for me either way. A great week all in all!  




I'll still complete the study but it's huge difference spending 2 hours vs 12 hours on study a day.
