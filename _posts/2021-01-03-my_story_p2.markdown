At some point during my teenage years, I formed the impression that to pursue further education in IT, would mean that had to learn to code. I wasn't in love with the idea of being a developer at the time based on my previous experience with BASIC, and so after I passed my GCSE in IT, I didn't pursue any further IT qualifications in college or University and moved away from studying IT.

I applied to <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/" target="_blank">Aberystwyth University</a> to study an English degree. I had gone to visit on one of their open days and fell in love with the small seaside town. I'd grown up in a big city, and it was such a difference to live in a smaller place that had such a strong student community and they held an excellent reputation for their English and Arts department. I was confirmed a place after getting my A-Level results and so at the end of the summer, I moved out of my home in Birmingham and went to live and study there for 3 years.

Not long after starting, my parents surprised me with a new computer which set me up for some years to come. It meant that I was able to start recording music and I began using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinberg_Cubase" target="_blank">Cubase SX3</a> in combination with my trusty <a href="https://www.roland.com/uk/products/xp-30/" target="_blank">Roland XP-30 Synthesizer</a>. I'd played the piano since I was 7 years old, and was now able to record things that I'd written. I also collaborated with other musicians and was able to write and record their parts on the same day. Using a computer to do music gave me a lot of creative freedom.  

Computers were common at university and almost everyone was using one in some way, even if just for writing essays. I also began to make friends with people who were doing lots of different things with computers, and I developed a range of new skills. I began to build PCs in my spare time, and I learnt how to build websites using HTML and CSS. I even learnt local area networking when my flatmate set up a network in our halls of residence to play games as a group. I particularly enjoyed being the go-to guy for computer issues, helping friends recover missing essays and fixing their machines that had stopped working. By the time I'd left university, I'd built several websites, and released two albums for my band using the PC.

At the end of university, I relocated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton" target="_blank">Brighton</a> to begin a new career. I still used computers often, and it remained one of my main hobbies for many years to come. I continued to write and record music on Cubase, and I still felt like the go-to guy for fixing computer issues for my friends. Things went well for me in Brighton and I've lived there ever since. It's a great place to live and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else. As well as being a great location, there's a strong IT base here including groups such as <a href="https://www.wiredsussex.com/" target="_blank">Wired Sussex</a> and <a href="https://asyncjs.com/" target="_blank">Async</a>.

After leaving university, I'd ruled out a career in a technical IT field as I'd assumed that my lack of qualifications meant the end of that road. I was happy though and still kept IT as a hobby. My English degree also meant that I had become a good writer and had strong proof-reading skills. I found these to be valuable skills throughout my career, which has often required in-depth writing.
