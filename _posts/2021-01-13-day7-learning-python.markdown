description: I'm now on my 7th day of learning Python.
---

In my <a href="/learning-to-code-in-python-day1/">last post</a>, I explained how I've committed to coding everyday for 100 days for a course in python. Things are going incredibly well and I'm feeling completely in the zone with studying.

I've now completed 7 days, and I've learnt how to create a variety of loops, functions, pseudo-random number generation and all sorts of things. Each day has built on the lessons by giving a small project where I'm given a task and have to complete it using both knowledge from the lessons and also what I can find out myself. I've been successful each time and really feel like I'm understanding the material.

I've created a github repository for the challenge where I'm adding these projects so I can see how far I've come. If you're interested in seeing what I'm writing, you can find that over <a href="https://github.com/tic0uk/python-100daysofcode" target="_blank">in my github.</a>

For the first few days, I worked out of the web browser environment at <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank">repl.it</a> which has meant typing in text and getting a text result printed out on screen. On the 6th day, I was introduced to a website called <a href="https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Alone&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Falone.json" target="_blank">Reeborg's World</a> as part of the daily lesson. The site basically has a small robot that you can move around a map and complete tasks. By the end of day 6, I'd written a program by myself that made it automatically move around a maze until it found the exit. There's no way I could have done this before I started and I can't even imagine where I'll be at by the end of the 100 days of coding.

I'm able to put a lot of time into study at the moment as I'm not working at the moment. I treat most days like a work day, which helps me keep up a good routine and I'm really enjoying having time with my wife and pets. As well as coding everyday, I've began training for my <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjS1e-KlJvuAhXNbsAKHXMYDvIQFjAAegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fcertification%2Fcertified-solutions-architect-associate%2F&usg=AOvVaw327ibxO-0Sar06Rzy1K1IQ" target="_blank">AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification</a> which I hope to take in a few weeks.
