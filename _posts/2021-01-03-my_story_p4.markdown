description: The fourth part of how the author of devopsapprentice.com started a career in IT.

Through my work as a senior application engineer, I regularly met up with developers and sysadmins and I began to aspire to build the combined skill set of a developer, an application engineer and a sysadmin. I completed an introductory course in PHP and began to read all code fixes that passed my desk. I took any chance I had to work on problems with the sysadmins and developers. As a result, I found myself developing a more well-rounded approach to systems, applications and clients.

After 3 years of working as a senior engineer, a vacancy came up within the infrastructure team, and so I put in an application to become a sysadmin. I put in a lot of study prior to the interview process and worked really hard to make sure I was ready for the interviews and technical test. After several weeks of interviewing, I was delighted to find that I'd got the job and I officially became a sysadmin. I was really proud to have gotten the job and felt my hard work had paid off.

As a sysadmin, I handled everything from support issues through to the building and setting up servers. I learnt AWS, Azure and other hosting providers control panels and learnt how to install, configure and optimise the full stack. As Kineo was a Linux house, this meant a heavy focus on Ubuntu, PHP, Apache, MySQL, and Postgres but we also ran some Windows Server boxes. I was able to draw on a lot on my work as an engineer which helped a lot. I also switched to using 3 monitors instead of 4 which still remains my favoured set up.

Shortly after the picture above, I stopped using Windows as my main OS on both my work and home machine and began to live out of Linux. Whilst I still dual boot a copy of Windows at home (as I still use it for gaming and when I need to be sure a document will come out as planned), it's mostly gathering dust at the moment.

I decided in early 2020 that I wanted to earn some qualifications in IT. I realised that I had been struggling to find time to study at work, and so I began to study at home. After taking several small courses, I began to self-fund a series of exams and passed them all. By the end I was studying almost daily outside of work. I improved dramatically from the extra practice and study without any distractions from work. If you want to find out more about the ones that I've taken so far, I've written a page about <a href="/mycertifications">my certifications</a>.

Having worked at the same place for 7 years, I began to look for a new challenge and began to apply for new jobs. I left Kineo and began working as a Technical Engineer for a Hosting Company specialising in VMWare vSphere and ESXi. It was a great move to work for a new company as it unveiled even more new areas that I wanted to learn about and I made a lot of nice friends there. I realised that this wasn't quite the right place for me and so made the decision to leave a few weeks ago.

It's been great taking a few weeks out to regroup. As well as looking for the right new job, I'm also spending most of my day studying and working in my homelab. I've also taken the opportunity to set up this website, my own mail server and a variety of other things. It's been nice using some of the skills I've learnt over the years to do my own thing. Once the site is up, I plan to help write about the various things that I'm learning. I've always made notes, so I came up with the idea to have them on display and help other people learning.   

That about wraps things up to date! If you want to get in touch, my social links are below for Email, Twitter, Linkedin, or see my Github page.
