DevOps initially began as a movement to create a better way of working between development and operations teams. 

Traditional IT companies of a reasonable size often would have the two sitting separately, and usually in a different part of the building under different management. Developers were the creators of the product and sysadmins were the team that ran the day to day operations building and looking after the computers that ran the code.

A developer who is expected to write good code needs time and space to think. It's a creative process for many as there are many ways to write code that does the same thing, and it's a constant learning journey for them as they discover things that work well and things that don't work so well. Some are logic problems, and some are problems with other peoples code that they're trying to write around. Throughout there's often a high pressure to make sure that their delivered product is made quickly and works to specification.  

The sysadmin on the other hand is responding to everyday issues and trying their best to run a system securely and with as much stability as possible.


It makes sense from an outside point of view that the teams would be separate.

Generally, sysadmins were the gatekeepers of the computers that ran the code that developers wrote.


It wasn't unusual that some companies would try to combine the roles in cost cutting exercies, or just happened to have that one person who knew everything and so was entrusted with the keys to the castle.



thompanies had different teams creating and supporting the backbone of their trade.  that had the luxury of having teams of developers and infrastructure were long-established, and had formed teams developers and operations had become their own separate entities. Developers worked to produce quality code solutions with an aim to get them production ready as quickly as possible, whilst the operational engineers worked to maintain uptime and protect the security and stability of the systems they watched over.

Over time, developers and operations struggled to work effectively together as they had conflicting primary goals. Developers were under pressure to quickly produce code in order to meet market demand, but whenever something new was introduced to production, it would affect the stability the system. As a result, operations became resistant to changes as they might introduce instability, and developers felt they were being blocked from being able to maintain the speed necessary to keep up with the company and market demand. The result over time was this was causing a deep-rooted tug of war between development and ops.

The specific purpose of DevOps was to combat a conflict between the two teams by creating a set of practices and culture that both could work by.  The main purpose of the DevOps movement was to create a set of practices which both sides can follow, so that the gaps between development and operations are blurred. With both sides following the same set of practices and using modern tools, then speed and stabilty are considered throughout the entire pipeline.  


I've seen on reddit a few times now where whenever someone asks if they need to be able code to work as a DevOps engineer, someone will point out that "without Dev, it's just Ops". The main purpose of DevOps is to create a set of practices which combines both development and operations in an attempt to blur the lines between departments. With both sides working together with the same rulesets, it helps to prevent the tug of war that often happens between two opposing roles.
