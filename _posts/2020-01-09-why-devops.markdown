DevOps initially began as a movement to create a better way of working between development and operations teams. In most larger companies, developers and operations were treated as separate entities. Developers worked to produce quality code solutions that were production ready as quickly as possible, whilst the operational engineers worked to maintain uptime and protect the security and stability of the systems they watched over.

Over time, developers and operations struggled to work effectively together as they had conflicting primary goals. Developers were under pressure to quickly produce code in order to meet market demand, but whenever something new was introduced to production, it would affect the stability the system. As a result, operations became resistant to changes as they might introduce instability, and developers felt they were being blocked from being able to maintain the speed necessary to keep up with the company and market demand. The result over time was this was causing a deep-rooted tug of war between development and ops.

The specific purpose of DevOps was to combat a conflict between the two teams by creating a set of practices and culture that both could work by.  The main purpose of the DevOps movement was to create a set of practices which both sides can follow, so that the gaps between development and operations are blurred. With both sides following the same set of practices and using modern tools, then speed and stabilty are considered throughout the entire pipeline.  


I've seen on reddit a few times now where whenever someone asks if they need to be able code to work as a DevOps engineer, someone will point out that "without Dev, it's just Ops". The main purpose of DevOps is to create a set of practices which combines both development and operations in an attempt to blur the lines between departments. With both sides working together with the same rulesets, it helps to prevent the tug of war that often happens between two opposing roles.
