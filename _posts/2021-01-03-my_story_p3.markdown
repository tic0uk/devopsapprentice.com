One summer, some years into my other career, a friend of mine offered to give me coding lessons in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C#</a> and I began to pick up some of the basics. An unexpected benefit was that during our many sessions, he reassured me that I didn't need any formal IT qualifications or to code to get into IT. He was a very respected Architect and to hear him say this gave me the confidence to begin applying for jobs in IT. I will always be grateful for that time and encouragement he gave.

My wife was also incredibly supportive during the career change and was the one who encouraged me to follow my heart and settle into a career that I'd be happy in. After a few months, I was interviewing for multiple IT jobs with different companies. I found I was able to reference a lot of my transferable skills from my old career.

I accepted a position working as a Client Services Manager for <a href="https://www.kineo.com/" target="_blank">City & Guilds Kineo</a> who host and support e-learning websites. My job involved managing clients and their support requests on <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank">Atlassian Jira</a>. This involved a lot of inter-departmental work and management to help get requests processed. I worked hard to get to know the software we sold and had lots of chats with people about tech and their work. As time went on, I found that I was helping the engineers with a few simple support requests and I aspired to do that job full-time.

I'd been working there for just over half a year when I was encouraged to apply for an engineer vacancy that had come up. The role was both hands-on and technical and I was excited to be considered for the position. I saw this as a big opportunity, giving everything I had in the application process. I passed the interview with flying colours and began working as an application engineer offering 2nd and 3rd line support to a large list of high-profile clients.

The seven-year-old me would have killed for the day that I began a job with four monitors! From day one, working as an engineer was a whirlwind of learning and I wanted to know everything. As well as getting to know <a href="https://www.totaralearning.com/" target="_blank">Totara</a> and <a href="https://moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> inside out, I also learnt how to write queries to interrogate PostgreSQL and MySQL databases, promoted code using Git version control. I was using the CLI of Linux daily too. Totara is a highly configurable web app and Kineo offered in house customisations, so there was a lot of variety in my work.

Prior to this job, I'd always held off using Linux as it had seemed so advanced and beyond me, but the more I used Linux, the easier it became. It helped that I found Linux to be similar to everything I'd learnt from using MS-DOS and Command Prompt in Windows. I began to connect the dots between the two Operating Systems and it made the learning journey a lot easier. Things that would have been very abstract turned out to be concepts I already knew.

Things went from strength to strength after that. I was promoted to senior application engineer 2 years later. I continued to build a strong background in technical support, and I built up a reputation as someone who would see things through and help get the job done. As a senior, on top of my job as an engineer, I was now recruiting, training and handling the day to day running of a team and I became more involved in complex and business-critical work.
