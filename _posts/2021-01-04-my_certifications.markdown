description: A list of IT certifications that the author of devopsapprentice.com has achieved since 2020 and my experiences with them.
---
I'd worked with Linux for around 6 years before I began studying in my spare time. Up until 2020 most of my learning was done on the job. Actual experience is hands-down the best way to learn, but as I progressed deeper into tech, I wanted to know more and more. As I progressed further, I found that there wasn't enough time at work to study things in-depth.

I had built up a lot of experience by this point, and had no problem installing a full web stack, tuning it, and apply security hardening as this was a part of my day job. Despite this, I recognised that I had some gaps in my knowledge across various areas that I wanted to fill in. I had also decided by this point that I wanted to transition into DevOps and recognise that I need time to learn the various tools and implementation strategies. To make it happen, I began to study out of work hours in March 2020 and committed to doing at least three evenings during the week and one full day at the weekend.

I've chosen to just cover certifications that I've taken below, however, I've also been filling out <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/users/timcraig" target="_blank">my Acclaim page</a> with general courses I've that I've completed.  

<h4>Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Practitioner</h4>

<img src="/_pictures/AWS-CloudPractitioner-2020.png" alt="AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Badge" class="leftimg" /></a> When I first began studying, I didn't intend to take any certifications. I signed up to Linux Academy (who are now partnered with <a href="https://go.acloud.guru">A Cloud Guru</a>) as they offered a variety of both short and long courses and also had sandbox sites and servers which seemed very useful. After a month of doing various smaller courses, I began their course for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/cloud-practitioner-essentials/" target="_blank">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</a> to see how I got on with studying for an official certification.

Linux Academy offered two versions which both had similar content, however, one was intended for hands-on users and the other course was aimed at users who wanted to be able to speak the language. They explained that the actual exam set by Amazon would be the latter, however, they wanted to offer the chance for a head-start for more technical users. I went for the technical version as this sounded like what I was looking for.

The Linux Academy course was fantastic and I learnt everything from building servers using AWS, load balancing, setting up subnets and access control lists. I also learnt the non-technical material during the course, so I felt well prepared for the exam. After 3 weeks of study and using their labs, I took their mock exam with no problems, so I felt ready to take the official exam with AWS. I signed up to take the official exam several days later online via Pearson Vue's web proctoring service.

The examination process was a little unnerving as I wasn't used to being monitored via webcam, but once I got into the swing of the exam it was all fine. I finished with lots of time to spare and at the conclusion I received the score immediately and found that I had passed with a score of 86%. I was very pleased with as it was my first official certification I'd taken and I felt that I had really learnt and understood the material. I found that the information that I'd learnt was instantly usable at work, including both terminology and theory. I began planning my next certification within a few days of passing.

<h4>CompTIA Network+ (N10-007)</h4>

For my next certification, I began studying for the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network" target="_blank">CompTIA Network+.</a> At the time, I felt I had a limited background in networking and it was one of my least favourite subjects. My job seemingly didn't often involve much networking, but when issues came up at work that did need me to debug network issues, I would feel out of my depth and it felt  very complicated. It felt like a good idea to take this course just to help make me more confident and knowledgable in the field.

Ironically, this ended up being my favourite course of all of the ones that I did. The course changed my whole approach to being a sysadmin and I couldn't recommend it enough. Amongst many things, I learnt subnetting, networking lingo and the theory behind it all. I finally understood the OSI and TCP/IP models and how to use them for troubleshooting. I even learnt how to use Wireshark and how to count in binary.

I studied for the exam using Udemy courses by <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-network-cert-n10-007-the-total-course/" target="_blank">Mike Meyers</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/networkplus/" target="_blank">Jason Dion</a>. I also used the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/network_plus_exam/" target="_blank">practice exams by Jason Dion.</a> I'd recommend all three and I got so much into their courses, that I began increasing the amount of time I put into study, finding myself studying almost every day in some form. After a month of studying, I felt ready to take the exam and so I signed up to take the exam a few days later.

The exam was online again, but I felt more used to the webcam proctoring this time. It was a tough exam, and I wouldn't have passed it without studying. It was difficult as the phrasing of the questions made it seem like there were multiple correct answers, but re-reading the questions and answers soon made it clear what they were looking for. There were also practical tests during the exam where I had to complete a technical test on areas of networking. I received my results at the end of the exam and got 89.5% which I was pleased with considering I had considered this a weak subject before I began.

Passing the Network+ was a big boost to my confidence. One thing that surprised me was how much of it was actually in my day to day job. There were quite a few things that I knew already, so this gave me confidence in my networking ability, but there were also new things I did daily after I understood networking. I became far more rounded in my skills as a sysadmin and whilst I have a lot more to learn I'm now very interested. It also helped me set up a lot of my own homelab networks using bridges and NAT. I'm considering taking the <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html" target="_blank">CCNA</a> next to try and learn even more and get to play with some Cisco hardware.

<h4>CompTIA Security+ SY0-501</h4>

<a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/36f9dfda-237e-4f91-bbbc-6538791551b3" target="_blank">
<img src="/_pictures/securityplus-badge.png" alt="CompTIA Security+ Badge" class="leftimg" /></a>

I chose the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security" target="_blank">CompTIA Security+</a> for my third certification, as this seemed to be the path that most people recommended after taking their Network+. As I began to study, I found the certification covered a lot more material that I already knew, however, there was a certain depth to things that I hadn't explored before and I found myself learning more about cryptography and encryption concepts, risk management and attacks.

Having had a good experience with the courses I used for Network+, I used Udemy courses by <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/" target="_blank">Mike Meyers</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-practice-exams/" target="_blank">Jason Dion</a> and used the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-practice-exams/" target="_blank">practice exams by Jason Dion.</a> I found the course material a little drier in places compared to their Network+, but this was because the certification included a lot of theory in security and business practices. It was still all very useful and I learnt a lot of security and business terminology which just became second nature from there onwards. It comes in handy in a lot of conversations at work. I also became <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/understanding-why-you-should-take-comptias-security-exam-for-dod-programs/" target="_blank">Department of Defence 8140 certified</a> which was pretty cool! By the end of the course, Jason and Mike had definitely covered everything I needed for the exam and I felt I knew the content well. After a month of study I booked the exam and took the test online  a few days later.

I found the exam easier than the Network+, however, I think this is because a lot of the material was already familiar to me before I began it. The exam consisted of multiple-choice questions and some hands-on practical questions which were interesting. I received my results at the end of the test and had passed with a score of 91%.

<h4>CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) CS0-001</h4>
<a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/3587b985-381e-4f2f-91a4-31ddae71fb77" target="_blank">
<img src="/_pictures/cysaplus-badge.png" alt="CompTIA CySA+ Badge" class="rightimg" /></a>

As I'd been successful in the Security+ exam, I began to consider whether a career in cybersecurity might be worth exploring. The <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst" target="_blank">Comptia CySA+</a> certification interested me as the course included a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_team_(computer_security)" target="_blank">blue team</a> syllabus with a focus on preventing and detecting security attacks. I gained a background in criminal investigations before I moved into IT, and it seemed there could be a reasonable cross-over here and so I began studying this one almost immediately after passing the Security+.

By this point I'd signed up to <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/" target="_blank">O'Reilly</a> who offered full video courses and books as part of their subscription. Jason Dion's CySA+ video course was in there so I used that. I also used his Udemy <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/comptiacsa/" target="_blank">practice exams.</a> I found that Linux Academy also had a course for CySA+ so I went through that one as well.

I took the exam a month I began studying. This exam was tougher than the others I'd taken and there was a heavy focus on risk analysis and log analytics, but I'd covered this well during my study so I felt prepared. After taking the exam online, I was pleased to have passed with 91%.

There were some really interesting parts in the course and I learnt a lot about the way threats can operate and can be detected. A few months after I took the exam, I came across a suspicious process that was running on an Ubuntu server that I happened to be working on. I ran an 'strace' command on the process and from the output, I immediately recognised that it was beaconing home to an IP address at regular intervals. The IP address it was reaching out to was a <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/command-and-control-server" target="_blank">command and control server</a> and it was successfully connecting each time. It's highly likely that at some point, the C&C would have sent something to the infected host such as a DDoS client or a trojan to commit some nefarious purpose. As it was a stand-alone cloud server with no other machines on the network, I blocked the C&C IP on the firewall and watched as the strace output showed the infected client was no longer reaching its endpoint. This bought time to work on removing the threat. I directly attribute the CySA+ course to me detecting the malware. I didn't even need an anti-virus to work out what was going on.

<h4>What's next?</h4>

<a href="/_pictures/threemonitorsetup.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="/_pictures/threemonitorsetup.jpg" alt="three monitor home set up" class="leftimg" /></a>After taking four exams in four months, I was all set to continue on the same path but I felt like I wanted to start doing more things in my homelab. To get as much hands-on experience as possible, I built a <a href="/myhomelab/">homelab</a> where I began spending a lot of my spare time. I'm currently working to complete <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/2s924h/how_did_you_get_your_start/cnnw1ma/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage" target="_blank">
this list by u/IConrad</a>. I'm also using my homelab to learn Ansible and plan to learn to code in Python. I've also created this website which has taken quite a bit of time to put together and theme but should be less maintenance now that everythings built.

I'm certain that I'll go on to take more certifications but I'm learning so much (and having a lot of fun) in my homelab that I don't want to break my streak! If you want to find out more about what I'm up to recently, you can read more over at  <a href="/homelab/">Homelab Projects & Activities</a>  

I'll update this page when I've started some more certifications!  

Thanks for reading,<br>
