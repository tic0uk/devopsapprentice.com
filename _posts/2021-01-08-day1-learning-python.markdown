description: I'm finally taking the plunge and learning python. Read about my first day learning and how I got on.
---
Throughout my life, I've been trying to learn to code. My very first time coding consisted of many hours copying out pages of code in BASIC when I was around 10 years old. At the time I lacked any real comprehension of what each part was doing and I didn't enjoy it at the time, giving up soon after. As I was 10 years old, it may sound like there wasn't a lesson there, but interestingly the other day I looked up the code on the web that I was inputting back then and to my surprise I was able to find it as it was a specific manual for the Sord M5. The bigger surprise was I found it was part of a manual that had a complete guide on coding in BASIC for beginners. I'd completely skipped past any learning and gone straight to the code.

The next time that I properly tried to learn to code was as an adult. Wanting to break into a new career in IT, I began having lessons with a friend and I spent 3 months trying to learn to code in C#. I learnt a lot during that time, but I didn't keep it up. It had reached a point where there were too many fundamentals that I couldn't understand and I wasn't able to progress past any blockers that I had.

I would practice coding, but whenever I got stuck I wasn't able to work around the problem until the next lesson where I could be given the answers. This made for a frustrating experience and also made me heavily reliant on my friend to teach me everything. The manual and guide that he'd recommended sat unused on my shelf. In a roundabout way, I'd repeated my first experience of learning to code as it was all practical work and no study.

I'd have written off coding completely by this point, but something in me still wanted to learn. Some years later, whilst working as a senior engineer, I wanted to become more effective at my job and so I made it my side mission to begin reading any PHP code that came across my desk. Understanding code wasn't a direct part of my job, but someone had suggested this as a way to passively improve my coding.

As I was promoting code fixes and projects on a daily basis, I read a lot of code! I made it a goal to just try to just get familiar with it even if I didn't learn it fully. In addition to this, I'd often discuss theory with developers and I began to pick up the lingo.

I still didn't write any code at this point, but I did feel far more confident in the concepts and structure. I also had begun to understand how to read the flow and debug code, which improved my skills dramatically. I also completed a introduction course to PHP on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-php" target="_blank">Code Academy</a> which helped me write a bit of code. This time around I was putting in the study, but not practising writing code.   

Around the time that I became a sysadmin, I evolved as a student. I began to place equal emphasis on study and practice, and as well as completing self-study, I also spent a lot of time practising the concepts in my homelab. I completed several courses on bash scripting and learnt the theory behind variables, functions, loops and arrays and also practised writing scripts in my day job. I could now put together a fully working script in bash using my notes and some google-fu, and I started to write scripts for use in my homelabs and at work.

Since I've spent the last few years learning to be a good sysadmin, I'm now ready to switch to learning to code. I've chosen Python as it is often described as one of the nicer languages to work with, as it has simpler syntax to read than others. It also is a strong choice of mine, as almost every sysadmin or DevOps type job advert lists it, and so I feel it would boost my career significantly from this respect. It also would be pretty cool to say I can code in Python!

I know that I learn best from a combination of videos and books, and so I've purchased a Udemy course called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021</a> by Dr Angela Yu which I picked up for Â£10.99 on sale. I chose this course as I've had good experiences with Udemy, I liked the style of Angela and it has very high reviews. As time goes on, I'll be supplementing this with various textbooks I've got on Python, and I also will use google where there are concepts that I need further explanation on.

The Udemy course is set to have you coding every day for 100 days straight and the videos are grouped into daily batches of lessons. By the end of the series, it promises that you should both be able to write code independently of the course. It also appeals to me that it promises you will have built working projects which you can demo in your own git repository. Hopefully, it should also mean that I will actually be useful rather than just being a copy and paste coder. We shall see!

I started day 1 of the course today. To begin with, I was asked to sign up to <a href="https://repl.it">https://repl.it/</a> which is an online integrated developer environment (IDE). It was surprisingly easy to be up and running and it allows you to code directly within a web browser of your choice within minutes. It's got the ability to create your own projects, or fork other people's code, and auto-saves any work you do. Everything is separated into project folders that you create.

The site is really pleasant to use and I highly recommend it. It has a console built-in, which means that you can see your results whenever you choose to run your code and also has an intelligent syntax checker which will warn you of mistakes. I can completely understand why Angela recommends it for the initial part of her course, and it was quite nice that I could get straight into coding without spending my first half-hour installing an IDE. The course will begin using Pycharm around day 14.

I've just completed the first day's lessons, and today I covered some basics such as variables, print statements and concatenation. At the end of the day's teaching, I was expected to put together a simple program by myself without any assistance. I was pleased to have gotten it right on the first attempt in less than a minute, which leaves me feeling incredibly positive about things. It looks like the prior study I've done in coding and bash is going to help with the fundamentals of Python which is great news.

I remember the first time that I learnt variables, it took me ages to wrap my head around them as it all seemed very abstract, but this time around it all seemed quite basic and things I already knew.

I know that it's going to get a lot trickier as time goes on but I'm feeling pretty proud of myself and hopefully this is the start of something really great.   

Thanks for reading,<br>
