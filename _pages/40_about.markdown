INCOMPLETE!
Hello,
<br><br>
My name's Tim, and I live in Brighton in the United Kingdom.
<br><br>
I created this site because I wanted to help give something back to the
on-line community that's helped me reach so many of my IT goals. I hope that it
helps you with something in the way that so many other sites have helped me.  
<br><br>
I've worked as an Engineer and Sysadmin for a combined 7 years in the UK, and I'm now
self-studying to build up my skills to the next level. My long-term goal is to
have a successful career as a DevOps Engineer, and so I'm learning
in depth about methodologies, tools and automation associated with the practice
of DevOps.
<br><br>
I'd worked with Linux for some years before I began studying properly. Up until
2020, most of my learning was done on the job. This is truly a great way to learn,
but as I progressed deeper into hands-on tech, I found there were all sorts of things
that I didn't know about. I realised that if I wanted to step things up to the next
level, it was time to begin putting in my own study out of work hours. If you want
to find out more about the ones I've taken so far (along with my reasons
for why I chose them), I've written a page about <a href="/mycertifications">my certifications.</a>
<br><br>
To get as much hands-on experience as possible, I've built a
<a href="/myhomelab/">homelab</a> where I spend a lot of my spare time. I'm
currently working to complete
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/2s924h/how_did_you_get_your_start/cnnw1ma/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage">
this list by u/IConrad</a>. I'm also using my homelab to learn Ansible and plan
to learn to code in Python. Find out more over at <a href="/homelab/">Homelab
Projects & Activities</a>    
<br><br>
If you want to know more about my back story, read more about me  <a href="/mystory/part1">how I got started in IT.</a> I've also created a blog, so if you're interested in my day-to-day
stuff, I'll be talking about various things going on in my labs
(and also quite likely writing about how awesome my dog is).
<br><br>
I've added my social media links to the bottom of all pages if you want to connect
outside of the site. If you have any feedback or questions, please <a href="mailto:info@devopsapprentice.com">send me an email</a>. I'll do my best to
answer all questions and I'm very open to feedback on the site or it's content.
I'm also welcome to offers from anyone who wants to help collaborate with the sites
content.
<br><br>
All the best,<br>
Tim
