  <h3 class="post-title">Part 2 - How I got started in IT</h3>
</header>
  One summer, many years into another career, a friend of mine began to give me
  coding lessons. It gave me the confidence to begin applying for jobs in IT, and
  it wasn't long until I landed a career as an Application Engineer specialising
  in supporting Totara and Moodle web applications based in the Cloud. I learnt
  Postgresql and Mysql databases and query writing, learnt Git for version control,
  and was regularly using the Linux CLI.

  I regularly hung out with Developers and Sysadmins and began to aspire to learn
  to have the combined skillset of a Developer, an Application Engineer and a
  Sysadmin. I completed an intro course in PHP and began to read all code fixes
  that passed my desk. I took any chance I had to work on problems with the
  Sysadmins and as a result I found myself developing a more well rounded approach
  to systems, applications and clients and was promoted to Senior Application Engineer.

  After several years, I successfully passed the technical test and interviews and became
  a Sysadmin. I also made the decision that I wanted to earn some qualifications
  in IT and so I self-funded a series of exams. I studied almost daily outside of work
  and passed all of the exams I took. If you want to know more, you can read about
  the certifications that I've taken (and my reasons why I chose them) by following this link.

  Recently, I was working as a Technical Engineer for a Hosting Company specialising in
  VMWare vSphere and ESXi which has unveiled even more new areas I want to learn about.
  Sadly, I found that this wasn't the right place for me and so took the plunge
  and have left and begun looking for another job. On the plus side, I've made a lot
  of nice friends there and it's given me more knowledge than any course could have
  done in the same amount of time so I'm pretty positive about things and ready
  for my next challenge!

  Thanks for reading, and my social links are below if you want to get in touch on
  Twitter, Linkedin, or see my Github page.

  All the best,<br>
  Tim
