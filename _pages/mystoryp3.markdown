  <h3 class="post-title">Part 3 - How I got started in IT</h3>
</header>
One summer, some years into my other career, I made the decision I was going to learn to code. I was keen to get into IT, and I saw this as the only route to be in a hands-on role. A friend of mine began to give me coding lessons in C#. I did pick up some of the basics, but a side benefit was during our many meet ups, he was quite insistent that I didn't need any formal IT qualifications to get into IT. He was a very respected Architect and to hear him say this gave me the confidence to begin applying for jobs in IT. It had always been a lifetime ambition to work with computers for a living, and this was the push I needed. I will always be grateful for that time and encouragement he gave.

I accepted a position working as a Client Services Manager for <a href="https://www.kineo.com/" target="_blank">City & Guilds Kineo</a> who host and support e-learning websites. My role was to manage the support requests coming into the team on <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank">Atlassian Jira</a> and involved a lot of inter-departmental work and management to help get requests processed. I found myself dipping into the odd support request and finishing it myself just to help speed things up.     

Within 9 months, I was approached by the Engineers who encouraged me to apply for a vacancy that had come up. At the time I hoped I was good enough. I actually found that this is incredibly common and often referred to as 'imposter syndrome'. I gave it everything I had in the application process, and was happy to let the team be the judge. I passed the interview with flying colours, and began work as a Support Application Engineer offering 2nd and 3rd line support to a large list of high-profile clients.

The seven year old me would have killed for the day that I began a job with four monitors! It was a whirlwind of learning. As well as getting to know <a href="https://www.totaralearning.com/">Totara</a> and <a href="https://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> inside out, I also learnt how to write queries to interrogate PostgreSQL and MySQL databases, promoted code using Git version control. I was using the CLI of Linux on a daily basis. It was a fantastic way to learn as Totara is highly configurable and Kineo offered in house customisations, so there was a lot of variety in my work. I really enjoyed it and it was a great job.   

Looking back, I'd always held off using Linux up until then. It had seemed so advanced and beyond me, but the more I used Linux, the easier it became. It helped a lot that I found Linux to be really similar to everything I'd learnt whilst using MS-DOS and Command Prompt in Windows. I had quickly begun to connect the dots between the two Operating Systems and it made the learning journey a lot easier. Things that would have been very abstract turned out to be concepts I already knew.

Things went from strength to strength after that. I was promoted to Senior Application Engineer 2 years later. I continued to build a strong background in technical support, and I built up a reputation as someone who would see things through and help get the job done. I also now was leading in the recruitment, training and the day to day management of a team.
