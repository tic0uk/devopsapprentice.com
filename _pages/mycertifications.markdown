After 6 years of working with Linux, I had a strange feeling that I was missing
something. I was able to complete my day to day tasks with no issues, but I
felt like I'd hit a roadblock. I was confident with what I knew, very unconfident

In January 2020, I made a pact to myself that I was going to begin working in
my own time to supersize myself in Linux and DevOps.


I'd worked with Linux for some years before I began studying properly. Up until
2020 most of my learning was done on the job. This is truly a great way to learn,
but as I progressed deeper into hands-on tech, I found there were all sorts of things
that I didn't know about. I realised that if I wanted to step things up to the next

  I began using Linux Academy
(who are now partners with <a href="https://go.acloud.guru">A Cloud Guru</a>)
to study some topics. After a month, I began to eye up the IT certifications
training they offered, and completed the AWS Cloud Practitioner training. I
was pleased, but it felt a bit pointless unless I took the real exam. I signed
up and after a little more study, I felt confident to take the exam and I passed!
I was delighted as I really had learnt the material and things I'd learnt were
immediately usable at work, from terminolgy to theory. I had the bug from here,
and so I began to study almost daily outside of work, and I passed all of the exams
I took. .<br><br>
