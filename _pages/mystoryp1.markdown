    <h3 class="post-title">Part 1 - How I got started in IT</h3>
  </header>

Hello, and thanks for visiting <a href="/">DevOpsApprentice.com!</a>

Since a very young age, I've always loved using computers. Windows was in it's
early stages when I used my first computer, and so I learnt to do everything in
the command prompt of MS-DOS.

I initially began using my father's work PC and soon graduated to
having my own computer. At first I just wanted to play games but as time went
on, I found it was common that things wouldn't work correctly or sometimes didn't
even run. As a result, I found that I was spending time debugging and fixing issues
just to get things working. I discovered that I enjoyed this part more than some of my games!

Most of the games I played were adventure games, which meant a lot of repetitive typing
as they expect you to type the exact phrase it understood. My spelling and typing skills began to soar from this and I was touch typing by the time I was 6 or 7. I
absolutely loved all of the Sierra On-Line Games from the 80s and games like
Kings Quest II (shown left) was my favourites.

As I grew older, it became second nature fixing problems that came up, and I
loved helping people out with computer issues. I built my own PCs, and also used
PCs for recording and making music using Cubase. Computers remained one of my
main hobbies for many years after leaving University.
