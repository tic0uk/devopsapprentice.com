Hello, and thanks for visiting <a href="/">DevOpsApprentice.com!</a>

I created this site because I wanted to help give something back to the
on-line community that's helped me reach so many of my IT goals. I hope that it
helps you with something in the way that so many other sites have helped me.  

For useful tips and guides that I've written please take a look at the articles
section of the site. If you're interested in my day-to-day activities, you can
find my blog where I'll be talking about various things going on in my labs (and
also quite likely writing about how awesome my dog is).

I'm currently working on becoming a DevOps Engineer. I spend a lot of time working
in my homelabs to try and get as much hands-on experience as possible. I'm
currently spending my spare time working on the infamous <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/2s924h/how_did_you_get_your_start/cnnw1ma/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage">
u/IConrad sysadmin project</a>. You can read my progress
on that project here.

I'm also learning Ansible and will be learning to code in python amongst other things.

If you would like to read about how I got started in IT, then you can read more by

All the best,<br>
Tim
