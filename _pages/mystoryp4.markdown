  <h3 class="post-title">Part 4 - How I got started in IT</h3>
</header>
I regularly hung out with developers and sysadmins and aspired to build the combined skill set of a Developer, an Application Engineer and a sysadmin. I completed an intro course in PHP and began to read all code fixes that passed my desk. I took any chance I had to work on problems with the
sysadmins and as a result I found myself developing a more well rounded approach to systems, applications and clients. After 3 years working as a senior, I decided I was ready to make my goal happen and when a vacancy came up, I put in an application to become a sysadmin.

I had several rounds of interviews and a technical test, and was delighted to find I'd got the job and was officially a sysadmin. This was a really big day for me and this was the point that I began to self-study.

As a sysadmin, I handled everything from support issues through to the building and setting up servers. I learnt AWS, Azure and other hosting providers control panels and learnt how to install, configure and optimise the full stack. As a Linux house, this meant a heavy focus on Ubuntu, PHP, Apache, MySQL, and Postgres but we also ran some Windows Server boxes too. I was able to draw on a lot of my existing work as an engineer which helped a lot but the self-study meant I could pick up things even quicker.

I made the decision in 2020 that I wanted to earn some qualifications in IT and realised that I never had time to study at work, so I self-funded a series of exams and studied almost daily outside of work. If you want to find out more about the ones that I've taken so far (along with my reasons for why I chose them), I've written a page about <a href="/mycertifications">my certifications.</a>.

Having worked at Kineo for 7 years, I began to look for a new challenge and began to apply for new jobs. I was successful and began working as a Technical Engineer for a Hosting Company specialising in VMWare vSphere and ESXi. It was a great move to work for a new company as it unveiled even more new areas that I wanted to learn about. I made a lot of nice friends there but I realised that this wasn't the right place for me and so made the decision to leave and begun looking for another job. I'm really positive about things and as well as looking for the right job, I'm spending most of my day studying and working in my homelab. I've also taken the opportunity to set up this website, and my own mail server, which has been a fun project to call on some of my skills I've learnt over the years.
